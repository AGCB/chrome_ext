# Text to Speech Chrome Extension

There was only about 15 lines of real code to figure out. 
First was grabbing text from highlight and saving that as a variable.
That was just a stack overflow away plus a little tweek.
Then we had to figure out how to "speak" words out of the browser.
We wrestled for a few hours trying to make an external library work (ResponsiveVoice.js).

Then a little googling brought us across this webAPI gem called speechSynthesisUtterance.
It turns out that we have had text to speech in browsers for a while now.
